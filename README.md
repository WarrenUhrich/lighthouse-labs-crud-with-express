## What is Express?

Framework for node.js apps to more easily accept HTTP Requests, and return HTTP responses.

## CRUD?

* Create (New Resource Form / Save)
* Read (Individual / Index)
* Update (Edit Form / Update)
* Delete

## GET vs. POST

### GET

myblog.com?id=3

* Is able to send a request with query parameters (right in the URL / address bar.)
* Easy to share / reproduce

### POST

* Not easily bookmarkable / reproducable
* Does not show submission values in address bar / URL.

## EJS

Used for making modularized HTML within a node.js back-end.

* Separation of Concerns
* Write HTML without formatting as a string
* Sprinkle in some JS logic / expressions if/where you need to

`/views`
